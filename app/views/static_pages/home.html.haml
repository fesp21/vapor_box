            “I didn't think Vapor Box would work for me. When I tried vaping for a few weeks, it was just too hard. There were so many starter kits, juices, and all kinds of accessories that I didn't have a clue about. Now, I just get what I need every month and don't have to think about it. I haven't smoked a real cigarette in over a month."
